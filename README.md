### About hero

**Thomas** - Lonely and slightly naive, Thomas likes to list his observations
about the world - and is absolutely fantastic at falling

**John** - Rather proud of his agility and sportiness, John quite likes an audience
so decides to look after Thomas and Chris.

**Claire** - Claire lacks confidence, she moves slowly and considers herself rubbish
at jumping. But then she discovers that she might be a superhero.
